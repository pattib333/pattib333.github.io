			<h2>Why Pet Photography?</h2>		
			<section id="story">
			
					<p>I have loved animals all of my life - their funny ways, their different personalities, and their fierce loyalty.  When you have a pet, you have a friend for life!  Unfortunately, they are taken from us much too quickly.
					My passion is to capture these precious moments – to celebrate new arrivals into your family; to preserve memories of a love that is like no other. I strive to capture your pet’s unique personality, and your pet's interactions with your family.</p>
