			<h2>Why Pet Photography?</h2>
				
				<section id="story">
					<h2>Capture your memories of your precious one now, so they can be with you forever.</h2>
					<p>From my lifelong love of animals, I have come to the realization that our precious pets are taken from us much too quickly.</p>
					<p>My passion is to capture those precious moments that you share with your pet – to preserve memories of a love that is like no other. I strive to capture your pet’s personality, and his/her interaction with you and your family.</p>

						<h3>Quick and Simple ($100)</h3>
						<p>A 30-minute studio-style shoot, to quickly get a few good shots of your buddy.</p>
						<h3>Home ($250)</h3>
						<p>Your pet is in a familiar environment, and so is much more relaxed and calm. Where do you and your buddy enjoy time together? In a favorite chair? Throwing the ball around in the yard? Walking to a favorite park?</p>
						<h3>Sports ($350)</h3>
						<p>Do you take your pet to sports events?  What about surfing? Or biking?</p>
						<h3>Glamour Shots ($500)</h3>
						<p>I partner with a trusted local pet groomer, so that your buddy can look his/her best when we do our photo shoot.</p>
						<p>Price of package includes grooming.</p>
						<h3>Tribute ($200)</h3>
						<p>Is your buddy ill or getting on in years?  Get those memories recorded now, so you can have him/her with you for a lifetime!</p>
