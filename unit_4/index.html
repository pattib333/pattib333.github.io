		<h2>Capture your memories of your precious one now, so they can be with you forever.</h2>
		<p>From my lifelong love of animals, I have come to the realization that our precious pets are taken from us much too quickly.</p>
		<p>My passion is to capture those precious moments that you share with your pet – to preserve memories of a love that is like no other. I strive to capture your pet’s personality, and his/her interaction with you and your family.</p>
